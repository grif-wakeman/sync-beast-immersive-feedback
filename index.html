        <h2>THE BEST FEEDBACK IS IMMERSIVE:</h2>
        <p>If you’re not writing music directly for agencies and brands, you’re not getting the real-world feedback that
            you
            need.</p>
        <p>I’ve designed the Sync Beast feedback system to give you the most concentrated, relevant, and actionable
            guidance
            on your music.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">CONCENTRATED</span> which means the feedback is only given by myself and other Sync Beast
            producers who live by the
            strategy.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">RELEVANT</span> which means we do our due diligence to meet you where you’re at based on
            context that you provide
            us.
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">ACTIONABLE</span> which means you’ll walk away with a list of action items you can take
            back to the lab or apply to
            more
            tracks.</p>
        <p>And since it happens in a 100% anonymous live group setting, you get to benefit from the feedback everyone
            else
            gets.</p>

        <div id="faq">
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">What makes the feedback immersive?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The best, fastest, most robust way to learn anything is to immerse yourself in it.</p>
                <p>It’s how people pick foreign languages up quickly.</p>
                <p>At Sync Beast, we have our own language and way of thinking about music written for brands.</p>
                <p>You get to be a fly on the wall as expert producers + songwriters talk openly and freely.</p>
                <p>You’ll get to learn what’s working about your music, what’s not working, and a language for how to
                    improve it.</p>
                <p>If you can communicate the problem, you can solve it.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">What makes the feedback anonymous?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>We have a special feedback system at Sync Beast that cultivates open conversation around improving
                    music.</p>
                <p>You submit a track for feedback and we strip it of all identity.</p>
                <p>Graham and the Sync Beast crew will hear your track for the first time live on the call – There is no
                    behind the scenes
                    preview.</p>
                <p>Anonymous feedback allows us to focus on the music without any biases so that you can get
                    pure, honest feedback on the music you make for sync.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">What if I don’t have music to submit for feedback?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>You can grab a Spectator Ticket to spectate the Feedback call.</p>
                <p>This ticket still grants access to the live Feedback call, you can ask questions, and
                    use the guidance in your future tracks and projects.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do I have to submit my track right away or do I have some
                time?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Depending on when you bought your Feedback Ticket, you may have some time to submit.</p>
                <p>In case you need time to find a track or make tweaks, we won’t close submissions down until Thursday
                    @ 10pm ET.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">What if I can’t make the live calls?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Whether you have prior obligations or you’re on the other side of the world, we want to make the
                    feedback and guidance accessible to you.</p>
                <p>You don’t have to show up live to get feedback on your
                    music.</p>
                <p>Grab a Feedback Ticket, submit your track, and catch the replay. Or you can grab a
                    Spectator Ticket if you don’t have music you’d like feedback on, but still want the replays.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">I’m nervous about getting feedback
                on my track.</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>By design, Sync Beast feedback is different from anywhere else you may get it: It’s anonymous, to
                    level the playing field.</p>
                <p>It’s based on data, not opinions. It’s focused on making your track more
                    valuable.</p>
                <p>All feedback is given by people who were once in your shoes, so we can relate to any nerves or
                    anxiety you might have.</p>
                <p>Hear from past attendees who were nervous at first, but were glad they joined:</p>
                <p>“Relax, you're in safe hands! The Sync Beast crew only want to help, so if you want super
                    focused and succinct feedback on how to improve your tracks on a multitude of levels - dive in!”
                </p>
                <p>“The price was great (affordable) and the insight i was given was invaluable. I learned a lot
                    from listening to the reviews of the other submissions as well.”</p>
                <p>“Just listen to the feedback and keep on trucking. No one can stop you from succeeding except
                    yourself.”</p>
